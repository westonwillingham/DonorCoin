## About this dApp

This is a dApp (Decentralized Application) that allows users to create and manage decentralized philanthropic initiatives. In centralized philanthropies, users have little control over where the
funds they donate are inevitably sent. Donors may trust established and competent philanthropies, but are risk averse to donating to new initiatives run by unknown or untrusted individuals. This dApp enables contributors to vote on where money is donated in these campaigns. The campaign manager cannot send money to fiduciary recipients without the majority approval of the contributors.

## How to Use This Application

If you have an idea for a philanthropic cause, you can create a campaign and set the minimum
contribution threshold for donors. You will serve as this campaigns manager. If users contributes this amount or more, they will be able to vote on the campaigns requests. Requests are proposals created by the campaign manager to send money to a philanthropic recipient.

If you are a campaign contributor, you may vote on campaigns by clicking the "Approve" button inside the Campaign Requests. Managers can finalize requests once a majority of contributors approve, and this money will automatically be sent to the recipients wallet address.
